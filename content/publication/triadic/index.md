abstract: Ecological, biochemical and neuronal networks are characterized by triadic interactions formed by one node regulating the interaction between two other nodes. However, little is known about the effect of triadic interactions on macroscopic network properties. Here, we show that the combination of positive and negative regulatory interactions turns percolation into a fully-fledged dynamical system where the giant connected component intermittently involves a different set of nodes, and the order parameter undergoes period doubling and a route to chaos. This phenomenon is captured by a theory validated by numerical simulations on both synthetic and real networks.
