abstract: Triadic interactions are general mechanisms by which a node or neuron can regulate directly the link or synapse between other two neurons. The regulation takes place in a familiar way by either depressing or facilitating synaptic transmission. Such interactions are ubiquitous in neural systems, accounting for axo-axonic synapses and tripartite synapses mediated by astrocytes, for instance, and have been related to neuronal and synaptic processes at different time-scales, including short and long-term synaptic plasticity. In the field of network science, triadic interactions have been shown to produce complex spatio-temporal patterns of connectivity. Here, we investigate the emergent behavior of an in silico neural medium constituted by a population of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons with triadic interactions. We observe that, depending on relevant parameters defining triadic interactions, different activity patterns emerge. These include i) a silent phase, ii) a low-activity phase in which complex spatio-temporal patterns of low neuronal firing rate emerge that propagate through the medium, iii) a high-activity phase characterized by complex spatio-temporal patterns of high neuronal firing rate that propagate through the neural medium as waves of high firing activity over a bulk of low activity neurons, and iv) a pseudo-blinking phase in which the neural medium switches between high and low activity states, in a similar fashion to up/down state transitions. Here we analyse in depth the features of such patterns and relate our findings to the recently proposed model of triadic percolation.
