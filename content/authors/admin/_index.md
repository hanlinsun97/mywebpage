Hanlin is a research fellow at NORDITA, Stockholm University and KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden funded by Wallenberg Initiative on Networks and Quantum Information (WINQ). He is interested in the dynamic processes on networks and higher-order network, inference and optimization on networks, as well as the interdisplinary area between network science and neuroscience.

Hanlin holds a Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics. During his PhD at Queen Mary University of London, he worked on network theory. His research focuses on several aspects of dynamic processes on networks and other structures with higher-order interactions, such as simplicial complexes and hypergraphs, under the supervision of Prof. Ginestra Bianconi. 

Before joining Queen Mary, Hanlin studied physics at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, China (BSc). During his undergraduate study, he worked on the inference and optimization on multiple interacting spreading processes on networks under the supervisor of Prof. David Saad, Aston University, and low-rank approximation algorithms on tensor networks under the supervisor of Prof. Pan Zhang, Institute of Theoretical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

He will start his new job as a MSCA fellow soon at University of Granada with Prof. Miguel Ángel Muñoz.
